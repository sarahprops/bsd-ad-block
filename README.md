### INIITAL IDEA:
an ad blocker that replaces a singular ad space with an image/text donation ask based on how many ads on a page are blocked

### REVISED IDEA
an ad blocker that inserts a small banner with a donation ask based on how many ads on a page are blocked

### PHASE 2 IDEAS:
1. refine the ad selectors to be more specific and more robust, like adblock
2. analytics based targeting of what charities/companies are shown based on what site the blocker is running on
3. cookie based remembering of closing out the banner
4. donation to the tools using QD
5. set up specific tools donation pages for the ask
6. move ask name/information into an offsite, managed document
