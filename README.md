### IDEA:
an ad blocker that replaces a singular ad space with an image/text donation ask based on how many ads on a page are blocked

### TO DO NON DEVELOPMENT:
1. Identify a list of 10ish nonprofits/charities/advocacy groups to be used as donation items
2. figure out how to control that information externally?
3. create generic image(s) for the ask
4. have unique sizing for each, depending on the ad space?
5. create general copy for ask
6. figure out rule set for donation ask (ie. 10 ads = $10, but 1000 ads != $1000)

### TO DO ON THE DEVELOPMENT SIDE:
1. build the ad block
2. build the requirements
3. make it rain
